# Bitrix24 Integration Setup Instructions

## Overview
The JavaScript file `js/bitrix24.js` has been created to replace the PHP functionality and integrate your website forms with Bitrix24 CRM.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Get Your Bitrix24 Webhook URL
1. Log in to your Bitrix24 account
2. Go to **Applications** â†’ **Webhooks** â†’ **Incoming webhooks**
3. Click **Add webhook**
4. Select **CRM** permissions
5. Copy the webhook URL (it looks like: `https://your-site.bitrix24.ru/rest/1/your-token/crm.lead.add.json`)

### 2. Configure the JavaScript File
Open `js/bitrix24.js` and update the configuration:

```javascript
// Replace these values with your actual Bitrix24 credentials
this.siteName = 'your-site-name'; // Extract from your webhook URL
this.token = 'your-webhook-token'; // Extract from your webhook URL
```

**Example:**
If your webhook URL is: `https://mycompany.bitrix24.ru/rest/1/abc123def456/crm.lead.add.json`
Then set:
```javascript
this.siteName = 'mycompany';
this.token = 'abc123def456';
```

### 3. Alternative Configuration Method
You can also update the configuration after the page loads by calling:

```javascript
// After the page loads, update the configuration
window.bitrix24Integration.updateConfig('your-site-name', 'your-webhook-token');
```

- Check that the webhook URL is correct

## Security Notes

- The webhook token is visible in the client-side code
- This is normal for Bitrix24 webhooks as they're designed for client-side use
- Webhook permissions should be limited to only what's needed (CRM leads)
- Consider using a separate webhook for production vs development

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your Bitrix24 webhook configuration
3. Test with a simple form submission first
4. Ensure all required fields are filled out

## Migration from PHP

The JavaScript version maintains compatibility with your existing forms and provides the same functionality as the original PHP code, but with better user experience and no server-side dependencies.
